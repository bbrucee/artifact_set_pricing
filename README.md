# artifact_set_pricing
Project dedicated to tracking the prices of Valve's new card game Artifact

https://store.steampowered.com/app/583950/Artifact/

Project basically exists here: https://github.com/ASriv98/parallel_and_distributed_final_project but chunks of it are still scattered

If Artifact playerbase ever returns/more expansions are released then I might look to expand on the project but for now it is in limbo
